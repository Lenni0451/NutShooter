# NutShooter
This time it's standalone.

## What is this?
A small (fun?) game. Mostly a joke.

## Building
I am only using Windows so I can only provide instructions for that.
### Requirements
 - [V](https://github.com/vlang/v)
 - msvc (Visual Studio C++ compiler)

### Instructions
Run `build.bat`. The output will be in the `build` folder.\
You only need the `nutshooter.exe` file.
